My on-going research using techniques of computer analysis to extract useful information for cracking this mysterious manuscript. [Introduction on the manuscript and links for further reading.](/voynich-manuscript/introduction)

### Raw data

* [Transcription (all folios in plain text)](/voynich/raw/voynich.txt)

Different transcription alphabets were created to help human and computer analysis, I chose the one called [EVA](http://www.voynich.nu/transcr.html) (Extended Voynich Alphabet). The file above is the best transcription, originally curated by [Takeshi Takahashi](http://www.voynich.com/) and reformatted by me, to be much better suited for modern programming languages and the human eye.
