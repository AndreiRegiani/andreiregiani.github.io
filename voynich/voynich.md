My on-going research using techniques of data analysis to extract useful information for cracking this mysterious manuscript.

* [Introduction on the manuscript and links for further reading](/voynich-manuscript/introduction)

### Raw data
Many different transcription alphabets were created in the last 70 years to help human and computer analysis, I picked one called `EVA (Extended Voynich Alphabet)`. The best transcription I found was made by Takeshi Takahashi, reformatted by me to be better suited for modern programming languages.

* Transcription (all folios in plain text)
