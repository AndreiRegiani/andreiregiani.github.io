Voynich Manuscript is an unique illustrated codex hand-written in early 15th century in an unknown language and writing system, no one has yet been able in deciphering the text of **240 pages**, not a single confirmed word has been decoded.

In this section of the website I'll be posting my on-going research, the goal is to create tools and generate reliable results that can be tested and used by others, hopefully to solve the mystery.

I will curate previous research done by other people, keep in mind there are many pseudo-scientific blogs and YouTube videos that claimed to have deciphered it, with unconvincing hypothesis.
