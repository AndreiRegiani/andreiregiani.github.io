Hello there. I use Python and C++ in the Linux ecosystem and open source technologies to develop secure, fast and scalable systems. I've been a professional developer for over 6 years and programming as hobby for 10. I have international experience having relocated and lived in Brazil, Bolivia, Belarus and Ukraine.

I've participated in all stages of a product life-cycle and developed for different plataforms (web, mobile, desktop) and industries (Fintech, e-commerce, gamedev), contributing from the software architecture until the public release of the new product/service.

I'm active on GitHub having a few interesting open source projects there of my own and trying to contribute to others whenever I can.
