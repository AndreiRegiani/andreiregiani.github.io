This is the name given to an unique illustrated codex hand-written in early 15th century in an unknown language and writing system, no one has yet been able in deciphering the text, not a single confirmed word. More background information can be found on [Wikipedia - Voynich Manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript){:target="_blank"}

In this page I'll be posting my own research using modern techniques of data analysis to extract useful information about this mysterious manuscript. My goal is to create tools and generate reliable results that can be tested and used by others.

I will also gather and curate previous research done by other people, keep in mind there are many pseudo-scientific blogs and YouTube videos that claimed to have deciphered it, with unconvincing -and sometimes- insane hypothesis.
