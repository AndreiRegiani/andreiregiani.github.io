This is my research and analysis using modern techniques of data analysis to discover useful information about this mysterious manuscript. My goal is to create tools and generate reliable information that can be tested used by others.

I will also gather and curate previous research done by other people, keep in mind there are many pseudo-scientific blogs and YouTube videos that claimed to have deciphered it, with unconvincing, sometimes insane hypothesis.

## Background
