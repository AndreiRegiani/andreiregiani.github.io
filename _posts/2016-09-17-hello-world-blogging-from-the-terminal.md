If you see this message, it means ~~the dinosaurs have scaped! DEFCON 2~~ *my website has been set up correctly*, here I'll keep updates on stuff I'm working on, mostly related to programming and technology. Under the hood it's made with `Jekyll` + `Jekyll-now` and hosted on `GitHub Pages`, which is a very nice solution for static websites, totally recommended.

The main difference to traditional CMS is the way to update and post, all is done via `Git` and the content is written in `GitHub Markdown`, and `GitHub Pages` will automatically update the server.
